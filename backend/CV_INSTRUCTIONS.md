# 📄 CV Setup Instructions

## Option 1: Use PDF (Recommended)

Simply copy your CV PDF file to:
```
backend/cv.pdf
```

That's it! The app will automatically read and parse your PDF.

## Option 2: Use Text File

If you prefer a text file, create:
```
backend/cv.txt
```

And paste your CV content as plain text.

---

**Note:** The app checks for `cv.pdf` first, then falls back to `cv.txt` if PDF is not found.

Make sure to add your actual CV before running the application!
